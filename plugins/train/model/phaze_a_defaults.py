    The default options for the faceswap Phaze-A Model plugin.

    Defaults files should be named <plugin_name>_defaults.py

    The following variables should be defined:

        "_DEFAULTS: A dictionary containing the options, defaults and meta information. The

               "   <metadata> dictionary requirements are listed below.

    The following keys are expected for the _DEFAULTS <metadata> dict:
        "datatype:  [required] A python type class. This limits the type of data that can be
               "   provided in the .ini file and ensures that the value is returned in the

               "   <class 'str'>, <class 'bool'>.
        "default:   [required] The default value for this option.
        "info:      [required] A string describing what this option does.
        "choices:   [optional] If this option's datatype is of <class 'str'> then valid

        "gui_radio: [optional] If <choices> are defined, this indicates that the GUI should use
               "   radio buttons rather than a combobox to display this option.
        "min_max:   [partial] For <class 'int'> and <class 'float'> data types this is required
               "   otherwise it is ignored. Should be a tuple of min and max accepted values.

"R|Masker to use.\n"
"L|bisenet-fp: Relatively lightweight NN based mask that provides more "
"refined control over the area to be masked including full head masking "
"(configurable in mask settings).\n"
"L|components: Mask designed to provide facial segmentation based on the "
"positioning of landmark locations. A convex hull is constructed around the "
"exterior of the landmarks to create a mask.\n"
"L|custom: A dummy mask that fills the mask area with all 1s or 0s "
"(configurable in settings). This is only required if you intend to manually "
"edit the custom masks yourself in the manual tool. This mask does not use "
"the GPU.\n"
"L|extended: Mask designed to provide facial segmentation based on the "
"positioning of landmark locations. A convex hull is constructed around the "
"exterior of the landmarks and the mask is extended upwards onto the "
"forehead.\n"
"L|vgg-clear: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly frontal "
"faces clear of obstructions. Profile faces and obstructions may result in "
"sub-par performance.\n"
"L|vgg-obstructed: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly "
"frontal faces. The mask model has been specifically trained to recognize "
"some facial obstructions (hands and eyeglasses). Profile faces may result in "
"sub-par performance.\n"
"L|unet-dfl: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly frontal "
"faces. The mask model has been trained by community members. Profile faces "
"may result in sub-par performance."

"L|output: Don't update the masks, just output the selected 'masker' for "
"review/editing in external tools to the given output folder.\n"
"L|import: Import masks that have been edited outside of faceswap into the "
"alignments file. Note: 'custom' must be the selected 'masker' and the masks "
"must be in the same format as the 'input-type' (frames or faces)"

"(but before the file extension). The frame number can be separated from the "
"rest of the filename by any non-numeric character and can be padded by any "
"number of zeros. The frame number must correspond correctly to the frame "
"number in the original video (starting from frame 1)."

"L|face: Centers the mask on the center of the face, adjusting for pitch and "
"yaw. Outside of requirements for full head masking/training, this is likely "
"to be the best choice.\n"
"L|head: Centers the mask on the center of the head, adjusting for pitch and "

"the full head (including hair) within the mask and are looking to train a "

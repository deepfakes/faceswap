"R|Masker to use.\n"
"L|bisenet-fp: Relatively lightweight NN based mask that provides more "
"refined control over the area to be masked including full head masking "
"(configurable in mask settings).\n"
"L|components: Mask designed to provide facial segmentation based on the "
"positioning of landmark locations. A convex hull is constructed around the "
"exterior of the landmarks to create a mask.\n"
"L|custom: A dummy mask that fills the mask area with all 1s or 0s "
"(configurable in settings). This is only required if you intend to manually "
"edit the custom masks yourself in the manual tool. This mask does not use "
"the GPU.\n"
"L|extended: Mask designed to provide facial segmentation based on the "
"positioning of landmark locations. A convex hull is constructed around the "
"exterior of the landmarks and the mask is extended upwards onto the "
"forehead.\n"
"L|vgg-clear: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly frontal "
"faces clear of obstructions. Profile faces and obstructions may result in "
"sub-par performance.\n"
"L|vgg-obstructed: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly "
"frontal faces. The mask model has been specifically trained to recognize "
"some facial obstructions (hands and eyeglasses). Profile faces may result in "
"sub-par performance.\n"
"L|unet-dfl: Mask designed to provide smart segmentation of mostly frontal "
"faces. The mask model has been trained by community members and will need "
"testing for further description. Profile faces may result in sub-par "
"performance."

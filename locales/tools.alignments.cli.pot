"R|Choose which action you want to perform. NB: All actions require an "
"alignments file (-a) to be passed in.\n"
"L|'draw': Draw landmarks on frames in the selected folder/video. A subfolder "
"will be created within the frames folder to hold the output.{0}\n"
"L|'extract': Re-extract faces from the source frames/video based on "
"alignment data. This is a lot quicker than re-detecting faces. Can pass in "
"the '-een' (--extract-every-n) parameter to only extract every nth frame."
"{1}\n"
"L|'from-faces': Generate alignment file(s) from a folder of extracted faces. "
"if the folder of faces comes from multiple sources, then multiple alignments "
"files will be created. NB: for faces which have been extracted folders of "
"source images, rather than a video, a single alignments file will be created "
"as there is no way for the process to know how many folders of images were "
"originally used. You do not need to provide an alignments file path to run "
"this job. {3}\n"
"L|'missing-alignments': Identify frames that do not exist in the alignments "
"file.{2}{0}\n"
"L|'missing-frames': Identify frames in the alignments file that do not "
"appear within the frames folder/video.{2}{0}\n"
"L|'multi-faces': Identify where multiple faces exist within the alignments "
"file.{2}{4}\n"
"L|'no-faces': Identify frames that exist within the alignment file but no "
"faces were detected.{2}{0}\n"
"L|'remove-faces': Remove deleted faces from an alignments file. The original "
"alignments file will be backed up.{3}\n"
"L|'rename' - Rename faces to correspond with their parent frame and position "
"index in the alignments file (i.e. how they are named after running extract)."
"{3}\n"
"L|'sort': Re-index the alignments from left to right. For alignments with "
"multiple faces this will ensure that the left-most face is at index 0.\n"
"L|'spatial': Perform spatial and temporal filtering to smooth alignments "
"(EXPERIMENTAL!)"

"R|Choose which action you want to perform. NB: All actions require an alignments file (-a) to be passed in.\n"
"L|'draw': Draw landmarks on frames in the selected folder/video. A subfolder will be created within the frames folder to hold the output.{0}\n"
"L|'extract': Re-extract faces from the source frames/video based on alignment data. This is a lot quicker than re-detecting faces. Can pass in the '-een' (--extract-every-n) parameter to only extract every nth frame.{1}\n"
"L|'missing-alignments': Identify frames that do not exist in the alignments file.{2}{0}\n"
"L|'missing-frames': Identify frames in the alignments file that do not appear within the frames folder/video.{2}{0}\n"
"L|'multi-faces': Identify where multiple faces exist within the alignments file.{2}{4}\n"
"L|'no-faces': Identify frames that exist within the alignment file but no faces were detected.{2}{0}\n"
"L|'remove-faces': Remove deleted faces from an alignments file. The original alignments file will be backed up.{3}\n"
"L|'rename' - Rename faces to correspond with their parent frame and position index in the alignments file (i.e. how they are named after running extract).{3}\n"
"L|'sort': Re-index the alignments from left to right. For alignments with multiple faces this will ensure that the left-most face is at index 0.\n"
"L|'spatial': Perform spatial and temporal filtering to smooth alignments (EXPERIMENTAL!)"

Setting to 100 will only extract faces that have been resized from 512px or above. A setting of 200 will only extract faces that have been downscaled from 1024px or above."

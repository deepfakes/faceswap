"R|Sort by method. Choose how images are sorted. \n"
"L|'blur': Sort faces by blurriness.\n"
"L|'blur-fft': Sort faces by fft filtered blurriness.\n"
"L|'distance' Sort faces by the estimated distance of the alignments from an 'average' face. This can be useful for eliminating misaligned faces.\n"
"L|'face': Use VGG Face to sort by face similarity. This uses a pairwise clustering algorithm to check the distances between 512 features on every face in your set and order them appropriately.\n"
"L|'face-cnn': Sort faces by their landmarks. You can adjust the threshold with the '-t' (--ref_threshold) option.\n"
"L|'face-cnn-dissim': Like 'face-cnn' but sorts by dissimilarity.\n"
"L|'face-yaw': Sort faces by Yaw (rotation left to right).\n"
"L|'hist': Sort faces by their color histogram. You can adjust the threshold with the '-t' (--ref_threshold) option.\n"
"L|'hist-dissim': Like 'hist' but sorts by dissimilarity.\n"
"L|'color-gray': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted grayscale color channel.\n"
"L|'color-luma': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Y color channel. Bright lighting and oversaturated images will be ranked first.\n"
"L|'color-green': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Cg color channel. Green images will be ranked first and red images will be last.\n"
"L|'color-orange': Sort images by the average intensity of the converted Co color channel. Orange images will be ranked first and blue images will be last.\n"
"L|'size': Sort images by their size in the original frame. Faces closer to the camera and from higher resolution sources will be sorted first, whilst faces further from the camera and from lower resolution sources will be sorted last.\n"
"L|'black-pixels': Sort images by their number of black pixels. Useful when faces are near borders and a large part of the image is black.\n"
"Default: face"

msgid "Float value. Minimum threshold to use for grouping comparison with 'face-cnn' and 'hist' methods. The lower the value the more discriminating the grouping is. Leaving -1.0 will allow the program set the default value automatically. For face-cnn 7.2 should be enough, with 4 being very discriminating. For hist 0.3 should be enough, with 0.2 being very discriminating. Be careful setting a value that's too low in a directory with many images, as this could result in a lot of directories being created. Defaults: face-cnn 7.2, hist 0.3"

msgid "Integer value. Number of folders that will be used to group by blur, face-yaw and black-pixels. For blur folder 0 will be the least blurry, while the last folder will be the blurriest. For face-yaw the number of bins is by how much 180 degrees is divided. So if you use 18, then each folder will be a 10 degree increment. Folder 0 will contain faces looking the most to the left whereas the last folder will contain the faces looking the most to the right. If the number of images doesn't divide evenly into the number of bins, the remaining images get put in the last bin. For black-pixels it represents the divider of the percentage of black pixels. For 10, first folder will have the faces with 0 to 10% black pixels, second 11 to 20%, etc. Default value: 5"

    Parameters
    ----------
    src : (M, N) array
        Source coordinates.
    dst : (M, N) array
        Destination coordinates.
    estimate_scale : bool
        Whether to estimate scaling factor.

    -------
    T : (N + 1, N + 1)
        The homogeneous similarity transformation matrix. The matrix contains
        NaN values only if the problem is not well-conditioned.

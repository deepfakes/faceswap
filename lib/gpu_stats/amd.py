class AMDStats(GPUStats):

    Notes
    -----
    The quality of data that returns is very much dependent on the OpenCL implementation used
    for a particular OS. Some data is just not available at all, so assumptions and substitutions
    are made where required. PlaidML is used as an interface into OpenCL to obtain the required
    information.

    PlaidML is explicitly initialized inside this class, as it can be called from the command line
    arguments to list available GPUs. PlaidML needs to be set up and configured to obtain reliable
    information. As the function :func:`setup_plaidml` is called very early within the Faceswap
    and launch process and it references this class, initial PlaidML setup can all be handled here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log: bool, optional
        Whether the class should output information to the logger. There may be occasions where the
        logger has not yet been set up when this class is queried. Attempting to log in these
        instances will raise an error. If GPU stats are being queried prior to the logger being
        available then this parameter should be set to ``False``. Otherwise set to ``True``.
        Default: ``True``

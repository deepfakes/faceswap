def read_image(filename, raise_error=False):
    """ Read an image file from a file location.

    Extends the functionality of :func:`cv2.imread()` by ensuring that an image was actually
    loaded. Errors can be logged and ignored so that the process can continue on an image load
    failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename: str
        Full path to the image to be loaded.
    raise_error: bool, optional
        If ``True``, then any failures (including the returned image being ``None``) will be
        raised. If ``False`` then an error message will be logged, but the error will not be
        raised. Default: ``False``

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The image in `BGR` channel order.

    Example
    -------
    >>> image_file = "/path/to/image.png"
    >>> try:
    >>>    image = read_image(image_file, raise_error=True)
    >>> except:

    Notes
    -----

def batch_convert_color(batch, colorspace):
    """ Convert a batch of images from one color space to another.

    Converts a batch of images by reshaping the batch prior to conversion rather than iterating
    over the images. This leads to a significant speed up in the convert process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch: numpy.ndarray
        A batch of images.
    colorspace: str
        The OpenCV Color Conversion Code suffix. For example for BGR to LAB this would be
        ``'BGR2LAB'``.
        See https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.1/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html for a full
        list of color codes.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The batch converted to the requested color space.

    Example
    -------
    >>> images_bgr = numpy.array([image1, image2, image3])
    >>> images_lab = batch_convert_color(images_bgr, "BGR2LAB")

    Notes
    -----
    This function is only compatible for color space conversions that have the same image shape
    for source and destination color spaces.

    If you use :func:`batch_convert_color` with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some
    information lost. For many cases, this will not be noticeable but it is recommended
    to use 32-bit images in cases that need the full range of colors or that convert an image
    before an operation and then convert back.

# <<< VIDEO UTILS >>> #
# ################### #

def count_frames_and_secs(filename, timeout=90):
    """ Count the number of frames and seconds in a video file.

    Adapted From :mod:`ffmpeg_imageio` to handle the issue of ffmpeg occasionally hanging
    inside a subprocess.

    If the operation times out then the process will try to read the data again, up to a total
    of 3 times. If the data still cannot be read then an exception will be raised.

    Note that this operation can be quite slow for large files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename: str
        Full path to the video to be analyzed.
    timeout: str, optional
        The amount of time in seconds to wait for the video data before aborting.
        Default: ``60``

    Returns
    -------
    nframes: int
        The number of frames in the given video file.
    nsecs: float
        The duration, in seconds, of the given video file.

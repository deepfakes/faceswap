# tensorflow is included within the docker image.
# If you are looking for dependencies for a manual install,

# NB: Tensorflow version 1.12 is the minimum supported version of Tensorflow.
#    If your graphics card support is below Cuda 9.0 you will need to either
#    compile tensorflow yourself or download a custom version.
#    Install 1.12.0<=tensorflow-gpu<=1.13.0 for CUDA 9.0
#    or tensorflow-gpu>=1.13.1 or tf-nightly-gpu for CUDA 10.0
